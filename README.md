# Review based RAG LLM FastAPI App

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API using FastAPI, Qdrant (vector database), and Google Vertex AI for embeddings and LLM. It supports both local development (with Docker Compose) and production (with Qdrant Cloud).

**Note:** This project was developed and tested with Python 3.13.5. Other Python 3.13.x versions should work, but earlier versions may not be compatible.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

### 2. **Start Qdrant with Docker Compose**
This will start a persistent Qdrant instance for local development.

```sh
docker-compose up -d qdrant
```

- Qdrant will be available at `localhost:6333`.

### 3. **Set Up Google Application Default Credentials**
- Make sure you have Vertex AI API enabled and run:
  ```sh
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```
- This creates the ADC file at `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`.

### 4. **Install Python Dependencies (for local runs)**
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. **Set Environment Variables**

#### **Local Development**
```sh
export QDRANT_HOST=localhost
export QDRANT_PORT=6333
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
export VERTEX_LOCATION=<gcp-region-associated-with-vertex-ai-api-credentials>
export VERTEX_PROJECT=<gcp-project-id-associated-with-vertex-ai-api-credentials>
```

### 6. **Embed Reviews into Qdrant**
This script will embed the sample reviews and upload them to your Qdrant instance.

```sh
python -m scripts.embed_reviews
```

- You should see output like:
  ```
  üß† Embedding 5 reviews one by one...
  ‚úÖ Inserted 5 reviews into collection 'reviews'.
  ```

### 7. **Run the FastAPI App Locally**
```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
- The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Interactive docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 8. **Test the API**
Send a POST request to the RAG endpoint:
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/rag/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What do people like about this place?", "place_id": "ChIJuVyExGENK4cRooPhJIUgnxk"}'
```

- To extract just the answer (requires `jq`):
  ```sh
  ... | jq -r '.answer'
  ```

You should see a response like this:
```
Based on the provided reviews, here are the things people like about this place:

*   **The Food and Drinks:** People praise the great taste and good quality of the ingredients. The menu is described as varied, with unique sandwiches as well as classics. One person called their sandwich "glorious" and the iced tea "restorative." The food is also seen as comforting.

*   **The Atmosphere and Ambiance:** The restaurant is described as a "local gem" with a cozy, iconic, and unfussy atmosphere. Reviewers enjoyed the interesting building, the great live music, and the peaceful patio for outdoor dining.

*   **The Staff:** The staff is noted as being peaceful, cheery, and helpful.

*   **Other Features:** The shop also offers a variety of other items for sale, such as cheeses, sausages, breads, and wines. The bathrooms were also noted to be clean.

## üê≥ Using Docker Compose for App and Qdrant

You can run both Qdrant and the FastAPI app with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Qdrant will be at [http://localhost:6333](http://localhost:6333)

You can check the status of the containers with:

```sh
docker-compose ps
```

and you can check the logs of both containers with:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Qdrant connection errors:**
  - Make sure Qdrant is running (`docker-compose up -d qdrant`).
  - Check that your app is using the correct host/port or URL/API key.
- **Vertex AI authentication errors:**
  - Ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set and points to your ADC file (locally).
  - On Cloud Run, use the default service account or set up Workload Identity.
- **No context returned:**
  - Make sure you ran the embedding script after Qdrant was started.
  - Check that the `place_id` in your query matches the reviews in Qdrant.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up

To stop and remove all containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
To remove all data (including Qdrant data):
```sh
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## üì¶ Production

- Use Qdrant Cloud by setting `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_API_KEY`.
- Run the embedding script from a cloud VM for large datasets for better speed and reliability.
- On Cloud Run, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is set automatically; set `VERTEX_LOCATION` as an env var.
